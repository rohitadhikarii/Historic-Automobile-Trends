# Historical Car Sales Data Visualization
This project provides dynamic visual insights into historical car sales data using Python and various powerful visualization tools. It aims to uncover trends, analyze sales performance over time, and display geographical sales differences across regions.

## Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled data manipulation using Pandas to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Static Data Visualizations: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create traditional graphs, such as line plots and bar charts, showcasing trends over time.
Interactive Dashboards: Built with Dash and Plotly to provide real-time interaction with sales data, enabling users to filter and explore key metrics dynamically.
Geospatial Mapping: Integrated Folium to create interactive maps visualizing regional sales data, offering a geographical perspective on car sales performance.

## Tools & Technologies
Python: Core programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static visualizations.
Dash & Plotly: For building interactive and responsive dashboards.
Folium: To create interactive maps showing geographical sales data.
Jupyter Notebooks: To structure the analysis and development process.

### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/historical-car-sales-visualization.git

### Navigate to the project directory:
cd historical-car-sales-visualization

### Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the Dash app locally:
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the dashboard.

### The interactive dashboard allows users to:
Filter data based on specific time periods.
Analyze sales trends using dynamic charts.
Explore geographical sales data through interactive maps.
Export visualizations for further reporting.

### File Structure
